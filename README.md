# big_data_report

<p>I designed a fake database to store "small" data for Linkedin with 6 tables - account, experience, education, message, activity and connections. Please see embedded image in the big_data_report file. Then I described the limitations of my design along with the potential benefits of moving to a Big Data solution. </p>
